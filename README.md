## Model

The core of Job Parakh is powered by machine learning and natural language processing models that assess job readiness based on user inputs and job descriptions. The model is saved as `clf.pkl` and is loaded when the application starts.

### Model Training

- The ML model is trained on a dataset of job descriptions and user qualifications to predict job suitability.
- NLP techniques are used to process and analyze text data, extracting relevant features like skills, experience, and qualifications.

To retrain the model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset, including text data for NLP processing.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
